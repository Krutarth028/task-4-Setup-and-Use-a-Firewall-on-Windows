cybersecurity internship task(4)- Configure and test basic firewall rules to allow or block traffic


## Objective:
Set up and test basic Windows Firewall rules by blocking and allowing specific ports.

## My Setup:
- OS: Windows 10
- Tool: Windows Defender Firewall (Advanced Settings)

## What I Did:
- Opened Windows Firewall settings
- Created a rule to *block port 23 (Telnet)* for security
- Allowed *port 22 (SSH)*
- Deleted the test rule after verifying it worked
- Took screenshots of each step

## Screenshots:
All screenshots are uploaded
– Firewall settings open
– Rule to block port 23
- Rule to allow port 22
– Rule deleted

## What I Learned:
- How to create and manage firewall rules
- Importance of blocking unused or insecure ports
- How to test and revert firewall changes safely

## Key Points:
- *Port 23* (Telnet) is insecure and should be blocked
- *Inbound rules* control incoming traffic
- Firewalls help protect systems from unauthorized access
